/**
 * Implements a general algorithm for finding shortest paths, which is a more efficient version of the classic
 * Bellman-Ford algorithm. Namely, it is the
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_Path_Faster_Algorithm">SPFA algorithm</a>.
 * This algorithm is significantly slower than {@link Dijkstra}, but it also supports negative edge weights.
 * <p>
 * The input is a directed graph with long integer edge weights (implicitly defined by an edge provider function)
 * and one or more source nodes. The edge provider function has to provide for each node {@code u} a collection of
 * (node, weight) pairs ({@link Dijkstra.Edge} objects) describing the outgoing directed edges of {@code u}.
 * This function might be applied to a single node multiple times as necessary in this algorithm.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm also supports negative edge weights, but the graph must not contain a directed cycle with negative
 * total weight. The current implementation might not terminate for such input. If there are no negative weights,
 * use {@link Dijkstra} instead, because it is faster.
 * <p>
 * A target predicate can also be specified in order to find path to a single node instead of all nodes.
 * However, in contrast with {@link Dijkstra}, it does not make the search process faster for this algorithm, and
 * the underlying graph must be finite.
 *
